Electric Bill Database Management System

Electricity consumers are often faced with the problem of inaccuracy and delay in monthly billing
due to the drawback in reading pattern and human errors. Thus, it is essential to have an efficient system 
for such purposes via electronic platform with consideration to proximity. The proposed system 
automates the conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the Electricity Board which is 
tiresome and time consuming. It is also designed to automate the electricity bill calculation and 
payment for user convenience. The system is developed with Goorm.io using node.js which can be used 
to develop websites, web applications and web services. The Structured Query Language (SQL) server 
is also used for creating back-end database. The system would be having two logins: the administrative 
and user login. The administrator can view the user's account details and can add, update or remove the 
customer's information of consuming units of energy of the current month in their account. The Admin 
has to feed the system with the electricity usage data into respective userâ€™s account. The system then 
calculates the electricity bill for every user and updates the information into their account every month. 
Users can then view their electric bill and pay before the month end.
